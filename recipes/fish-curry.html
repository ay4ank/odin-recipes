    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>This Indian fish curry is a very spicy dish. The recipe was inspired by a Bengali fish recipe my mother used to make in India. This recipe is easy to make and will be ready in just 30 minutes to be served with hot steaming rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>5 cashew halves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped tomato</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix 2 tablespoons oil, mustard, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a shallow glass bowl.</li>
        <li>Add fish and turn to coat. Cover and refreigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the fish is marinating, combine onion, garlic, ginger, and cashews in a blender or food processor; pulse until mixture forms a paste.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add cashew paste; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cayenne pepper, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, coriander, sugar, and turmeric to the cashew paste in the skillet; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir in tomato and broth.</li>
        <li>Remove fish from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Arrange fish in a baking dish and pour sauce over top.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
